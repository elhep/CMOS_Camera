\chapter{Camera design}

In this chapter a design of the camera is presented . First of all, an electrical design is shown of the processor board as well as of the sensor board. Next, the hardware design is presented together with SI/PI simulation.
At the end of the chapter, measurements of physical characteristics of the boards are presented.
