\chapter{Concept of design}
In this chapter a concept of the design of the camera is presented. Firstly, main camera requirements are shown and juxtaposed with possible solutions. Afterwards the specification of the design is described in detail.

\section{Main requirements}

\subsection{Mechanical design}
The camera will be mounted on the UAVs as well as planes. For this reason weight and size are constrained. The weight of the whole camera system shall be less than 2.5 kg. Whereas the size is constrained to the size of the optical mirror system for the hyper-spectral camera as well as master acquisition electronic module. 
Thus, the physical dimensions of the embedded camera are unconstrained. Standard 42x42 mm form factor was chosen so that the typical lens mounts and chassis can be used. 

\subsection{Sensor}

\subsection{Main processing unit}

\subsection{High speed interfaces}


\begin{itemize}
\item Framerate at 100 fps at 2048 x 2048 resolution
\item High speed interface 
\item Processing capability
\item Possible IMU integration
\end{itemize}

\section{Final specification}

\begin{itemize}
\item Framerate at 180 fps at 2048 x 2048 resolution
for CMV4000 and 100 fps for CIS1910F
\item 6.25 Gbps interfaces: SDI, CoaXPress, Aurora, PCie
\item FPGA fabric for processing ability
\item RS485 for communication with IMU and master controller

\end{itemize}
