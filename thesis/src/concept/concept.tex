\chapter{Concept of design}
In this chapter a concept of the design of the camera is presented. First of all, main camera requirements are shown and juxtaposed with possible solutions. Afterwards the specification of the design is described in detail.

\section{Main requirements}

\begin{itemize}
\item Framerate at 100 fps at 2048 x 2048 resolution
\item High speed interface 
\item Processing capability
\item Possible IMU integration
\end{itemize}

\section{Specification}

\begin{itemize}
\item Framerate at 180 fps at 2048 x 2048 resolution
for CMV4000 and 100 fps for CIS1910F
\item 6.25 Gbps interfaces: SDI, CoaXPress, Aurora, PCie
\item FPGA fabric for processing ability
\item RS485 for communication with IMU and master controller

\end{itemize}
