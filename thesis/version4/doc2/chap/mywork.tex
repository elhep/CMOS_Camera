%Due to the fact that the design of the camera framework was a multidisciplinary project, some parts of it were designed by
%students and associates of The Institute of Electronics Systems, Photonics and Web Engineering Group and Division of
%Television, Institute Radioelectronics and Multimedia Technology at Warsaw University of 
%Technology.
