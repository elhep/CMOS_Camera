\begin{itemize}
\item Linux runs on one ARM Core (CPU0) \cite{XilinxZynqWiki}
\item Baremetal application runs on CPU1 (it is handling exceptions from PL)
\item PTP timestamp is being placed in OCM memory
\item CCD driver is made in PL 
\item Shutter driver is made in PL
\item Network boot for Zynq with u-boot bootscript for failsafe \cite{TIWikiUBoot,UbootParsing}
\item Network boot with read only FS via NFS?
\item Archive on remote attached storage
\item Failsafe of Linux OS?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Failsafe reporting specification}

How will the system report error on following cases? 
What needs to be solved is how will reporting be done before linux boots.
There can be a system checker IP in logic but it doesn't check e.g. power suppiles. Such an IP can generate heartbit. 

Assumptions:
\begin{itemize}
\item It is assumed that device is powered properly and all of the power lines
are ok.
\end{itemize}

Interfaces for reporting errors:
\begin{itemize}
\item RS485
\item Ethernet

\end{itemize}

TO DO
\begin{itemize}
\item Learn how does the Zynq Watchdog works. 
\end{itemize}
