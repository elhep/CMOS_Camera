\section{Digital system design}
\subsection{Zynq MAC PTP filter}
Xilinx Zynq SoC has an integrated Media Access Controller for 10/100/1000 Mbps Ethernet. MAC supports
IEEE1588\cite[16.2.7]{XIL:UG585}, but it's Timestamping Unit is limitted as mentioned before. Nevertheless,
the MAC PTP packet filter can be used to implement custom TSU. 
\subsubsection{Zynq MAC PTP signal test}
In order to validate the signals coming out from the PTP a simple test was performed

Done
- basic digital system with ptp signals connected to chipscope
- added register connected to axi to test whether it can be added through uio to xemacps
- run qemu on host for zc706
- modified the petalinux device tree to support phy
