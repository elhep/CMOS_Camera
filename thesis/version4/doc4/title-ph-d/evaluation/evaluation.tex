\chapter{Evaluation of high speed interfaces for aerial hyper-spectral camera}


In this chapter an evaluation of high speed interfaces for aerial hyper-spectral application is presented. Firstly, the hypothesis of the evaluation is stated, then two high speed interfaces are used for hypothesis testing. At the end the results of the study are presented.
