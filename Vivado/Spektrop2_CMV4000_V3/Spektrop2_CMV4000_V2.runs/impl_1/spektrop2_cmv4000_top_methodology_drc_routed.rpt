2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-2#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock source pin  
A primary clock tsc_ms1_top_i/inst_clocking/clk_gen0_inst/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate pin tsc_ms1_top_i/inst_clocking/clk_gen0_inst/inst/clk_in1. It is recommended to create a primary clock only on a proper clock source (input port or primitive output pin with no timing arc)
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-4#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock tsc_ms1_top_i/inst_clocking/clk_gen0_inst/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock clk_fpga_1 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out2_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out2_clk_wiz_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out4_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out4_clk_wiz_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out2_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out2_clk_wiz_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#2 Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_fpga_0 and clk_out4_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_fpga_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out4_clk_wiz_0]
Related violations: <none>
